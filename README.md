Report Abstract: 

Computational simulations are extremely useful in modelling experiments; they allow us to make predictions about real systems in response to changing conditions. The Jacobi relaxation algorithm is used to solve the Laplace's equation to build a computational model of the electric potential field and the electric field in two systems: a cross-section of a coaxial cable and an experimental set-up for the Electric Dipole Moment experiment. The convergence time is found to have a 4th-order dependence on the resolution. The report analyses the effectiveness of the computational method and discusses its limitations.
